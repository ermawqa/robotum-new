                The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent

                destruction of the Data.

                Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT-enabled
                tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
                related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
                the following applies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                  purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of a
                  contract with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                  obligations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                  to which the Owner is subject.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                  public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in the Owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                  interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
                legal basis that applies to the processing. In particular,
                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
                into a contract.

              <h3 className="text-text1 font-semibold mt-4">Place</h3>
              <p>
                The Data is processed at the Owner’s operating offices and in
                any other places where the parties involved in the processing
                are located.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the User’s location, data transfers may involve
                transferring the User’s Data to a country other than their own.
                To find out more about such transfers, Users can check the
                relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner.

              <p>
                Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
                required by the purpose they have been collected for. Therefore:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Personal Data collected for contract performance between the
                  Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has

                  Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s
                  legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
                  fulfill such purposes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
                period whenever the User has given consent to such processing
                and such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
                obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
                required by law or by an order of an authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be
                deleted. Therefore, the right to access, erasure, rectification,
                and data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
                the retention period.
