                RoboTUM Diversity &amp; Gender Equality Plan
              </h2>
              <p>
                RoboTUM fosters a culture of integrity, open mindedness, and
                tolerance. It recognizes the value created through diversity and
                respect as a central guiding principle for its proven success:
                It is the diversity of its scientists, students, and employees
                that makes RoboTUM an innovative and dynamic organization.
                RoboTUM is thus committed to holistic diversity management that
                actively promotes the equality of talent, irrespective of
                gender, nationality, religion, ideology, physical ability, age,
                sexual identity, or socioeconomic status. RoboTUM translates
                this commitment into numerous concrete measures, many of which
                have already been successfully implemented, established, and
                optimized since the publication of the first Diversity &amp;
                Gender Equality Plan at the end of 2024. With the publication of
                the current Diversity &amp; Gender Equality Plan, RoboTUM
                reaffirms its forward looking vision of establishing an ever
                more inclusive organizational culture through ongoing efforts in
                the context of systematic diversity management, which is
                reflected in the continuation, further development, and renewal
                of diversity measures.
