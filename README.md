# 🤖 RoboTUM Website

This is the official website for **RoboTUM**, a student robotics initiative at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).  
Our mission is to bridge the gap between academia and industry in robotics by showcasing our projects, events, and collaborations.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this site is fully responsive, modular, and designed for scalability.

## 🌍 Vision

To establish Munich as a global hub for robotics innovation and collaboration.

## 🎯 Goals

- Showcase RoboTUM’s technical, operational, and innovation projects.
- Highlight sponsors, events, and academic partnerships.
- Provide an easy way for new students and companies to get involved.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (custom design system in `globals.css`)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **Component System:** Reusable components (`Button`, `ImageFrame`, etc.)
- **Data Management:** Static JS data files (e.g., `/src/data/projects.js`)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (temporary) → Custom Domain (production)

- Define reusable data in `/data/*.js` instead of hardcoding.
- Use the shared `Button` and `ImageFrame` components for UI consistency.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `refactor:` code improvement
  - `style:` visual or formatting changes
